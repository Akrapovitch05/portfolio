# 🚀 Portfolio Project Summary: From Zero to Deployment

This document chronicles the complete development journey of **Akram Kibout's Digital Portfolio**, built to showcase full-stack engineering skills and secure a 3-year apprenticeship.

---

## 1. 🏗️ Foundations & Architecture
**Objective**: Build a modern, high-performance, and visually striking personal site.

*   **Tech Stack Selection**:
    *   **Next.js 14**: For React Server Components and static export capabilities.
    *   **Tailwind CSS (v4)**: For rapid, utility-first styling.
    *   **Framer Motion**: For smooth, professional animations.
    *   **Lucide React**: For consistent, clean iconography.
*   **Design Philosophy**: adopted the **"Bento Grid"** aesthetic (Apple/Linear style) for a modular, data-dense, yet clean layout.
*   **Structure**: Setup a clean `app` directory structure with modular components (`components/`) to ensure maintainability.

---

## 2. 🧩 Core Component Development
We built the site block by block:

### A. The Bento Grid System
Developed a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid that adapts from single-column (mobile) to multi-column (desktop).
*   **[BentoCard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/akram/PhpstormProjects/portfolio/components/BentoCard.tsx)**: A reusable wrapper component featuring a "glassmorphism" effect (translucent background, subtle borders) and hover animations.

### B. Content Blocks
1.  **Hero Section**:
    *   Integrated your profile picture ([me.jpg](file:///c:/Users/akram/PhpstormProjects/portfolio/public/me.jpg)) with a glowing hover effect.
    *   Added professional bio, location, and key "soft skills" tags.
2.  **Tech Stack**:
    *   Refactored a simple list into organized categories: **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **DevOps/Tools**.
    *   Added color-coded icons (React, Symfony, Docker, etc.) for visual distinction.
3.  **Vlogs & Personal**:
    *   Created a section for your **YouTube Channel** to show personality.
    *   Implemented a custom **Video Modal** to play videos directly on the site without redirecting users away.
4.  **Experience**:
    *   Detailed your background in **Logistics/Transport** to show industry knowledge relevant to your target sector.

## 3. 🚚 Flagship Project: "H Transport ERP"
This was the centerpiece of the portfolio. We treated it as a full case study.

*   **Project Modal**: Created [ProjectDetails.tsx](file:///c:/Users/akram/PhpstormProjects/portfolio/components/ProjectDetails.tsx), a comprehensive modal that opens when clicking the main project card.
*   **Narrative**: Clearly articulated the **Problem** (Excel files, manual work), the **Solution** (Custom ERP/CRM), and the **Impact** (-30% admin time).
*   **Real Assets Integration**:
    *   Replaced generic placeholders with **REAL screenshots** you provided:
        *   *Admin Dashboard* (Full width view).
        *   *Mobile App Interface* (Driver input & tour details).
    *   Added "Mission Alternance" badge to highlight the context.

## 4. 🎨 Visual Polish & User Experience
We refined the "look and feel" to be premium and modern.

*   **"Too Dark" Fix**: Added subtle, animated **gradient orbs** (Indigo/Purple) in the background to add depth and life to the dark theme.
*   **Spotlight Effect**: Implemented a mouse-tracking light effect ([Spotlight.tsx](file:///c:/Users/akram/PhpstormProjects/portfolio/components/Spotlight.tsx)) that reveals card borders as you move.
*   **Performance Fix (The "Lag" Issue)**:
    *   *Problem*: The initial Spotlight component caused high Input Latency (INP > 500ms) because it triggered React re-renders on every mouse pixel movement.
    *   *Solution*: Rewrote the component to use **Direct DOM Manipulation** and `requestAnimationFrame`, completely eliminating the lag.

---

## 5. 🔍 SEO & Professional Credibility
We ensured Google (and recruiters) see the site as a professional entity.

*   **Structured Data (JSON-LD)**: Injected `Person` schema so search engines understand who "Akram Kibout" is (Job Title, Alumni of CESI, Social Links).
*   **Metadata**: Configured dynamic titles, descriptions, and OpenGraph tags for rich previews on LinkedIn/Discord.
*   **Crawlability**: Generated automated `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` files.

---

## 6. 🚀 Automated Deployment (CI/CD)
The final and most complex step: creating a "set it and forget it" workflow.

*   **Infrastructure**: Targeted **O2Switch** (cPanel/Apache) hosting.
*   **The Challenge**: O2Switch's firewall blocked standard SSH/SCP connections from GitHub Actions because GitHub's IP addresses rotate constantly.
*   **The Solution**:
    1.  Configured **GitHub Secrets** (`HOST`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`) for security.
    2.  Built a custom **GitHub Actions Workflow** ([deploy.yml](file:///c:/Users/akram/PhpstormProjects/portfolio/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).
    3.  Switched from SCP to **FTP Deployment** (`FTP-Deploy-Action`) to successfully bypass the firewall restrictions.
*   **Result**: Now, every time you run `git push`, the site is automatically built, optimized, and deployed to `akramkibout.fr` in minutes.
